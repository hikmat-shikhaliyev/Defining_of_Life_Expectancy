# Defining_of_Life_Expectancy

This project contains python code for data preprocessing and modeling using various machine learning algorithms. The code includes data preprocessing steps such as handling missing values, scaling, and feature selection, as well as modeling using different machine learning algorithms such as Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost, Support Vector Regression (SVR), and a Stacking model.

#### Data Preprocessing
The script begins with data preprocessing steps, including handling missing values, scaling the data, and performing feature selection based on the correlation with the target variable.

#### Modeling
The script then proceeds to model the data using various machine learning algorithms such as Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regression, Random Forest Regression, XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost, Support Vector Regression (SVR), and a Stacking model. For each model, the script evaluates the performance using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared (R2) on both the training and testing datasets.

#### Univariate Analysis
The script also includes univariate analysis to evaluate the performance of the CatBoost model with categorical columns.

#### Results
The results of the modeling and univariate analysis are presented in tabular format, showing the performance metrics for each variable and model.

Overall, the code covers a comprehensive approach to data preprocessing and modeling using various machine learning algorithms, along with evaluating the performance of each model.
